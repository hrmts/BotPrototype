# Introduction

Here i test different chatbots in order to teach myself to create
them and see if any of them have any practical use.

To test the bots go into the bot's folder and run node on the main
javascript app.
The bot will then be hosted on localhost:3978 and you can use the
[Microsoft BotFramework Emulator](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-Emulator) to interact with it.

# Different Bots
## Generell prototype

I use this prototype to test different features of the MS Bot
framework and relevant technologies.

Currently testing: Prompts, LUIS,

## Prototype 1

This bot will be the first real bot developed to accomplish a task.

Here i want to explore the architecture of building a bot with the
framework and research the best ways to handle interacting with the
user.

This bot will be the "father" to the eventual job application bot. I
will be developing this until it has a functioning system to take
all the needed data to submit a job application from the user.
