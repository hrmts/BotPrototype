# Bot prototyping

Here i test different chatbots and see if they are ready for
for practical use.

# Generell prototype

I use this prototype to test diffrent features of the MS Bot framework
and relevant technologies.

Currently testing: Prompts, LUIS,

# Prototype 1

This bot will be the first real bot developed to accomplish a task.

Here i want to explore the architecture of building a bot with the
framework and research the best ways to handle interacting with the
user.

This bot will be the "father" to the eventual job application bot. I
will be developing this until it has a functioning system to take
all the needed data to submit a job application from the user.
